[00:05.68] Through the valley of lies
[00:09.14] Through the valley of lies
[00:22.14] 
[00:13.39] I'm walking through the valley of lies
[00:16.72] I see a coffin, perfect fit for my size
[00:20.15] They won't open, got silky stitch in my eye
[00:23.58] I'm hurting, and I lost my heart in the sky
[00:45.08] 
[00:27.15] Taking trips down uncharted roads
[00:29.53] Them very lonely roads
[00:31.13] Looking for a pot of gold
[00:32.98] Your love was not enough
[00:34.46] It don't make no sense to me
[00:36.25] And now you're begging, "Please"
[00:37.77] Remember you was hurting me
[00:39.72] Well, keep that energy
[00:50.72] 
[00:41.61] I've been waiting
[00:45.11] Knowing you won't show up
[00:48.54] Don't make no sense
[00:51.86] I'm not (I'm not giving in)
[01:05.36] 
[00:54.72] I'm walking through the valley of lies
[00:57.72] I see a coffin, perfect fit for my size
[01:01.13] They won't open, got silky stitch in my eye
[01:05.01] I'm hurting, and I lost my heart in the sky
[01:26.51] 
[01:10.58] On, and on, and on (and on)
[01:13.52] Keep fighting, Armageddon
[01:16.84] Now things are getting rough
[01:19.43] I never thought you'd be a lesson
[01:24.18] Go, you go, you go
[01:27.15] How come I never see ya?
[01:30.59] I'm really getting close to giving up
[01:34.94] I hate the feeling
[01:43.94] 
[01:36.59] Yeah, through the valley of your lies
[01:38.57] The water keeps flowing down
[01:40.28] You won't believe it's all from my eyes
[01:42.48] Thought you were the one (one)
[01:43.60] You tarnished our love (love)
[01:45.43] Yeah, with your liar's tongue (tongue)
[02:04.43] 
[01:47.37] After all
[01:48.46] You knew that we would end up this way
[01:51.76] I never knew my love would turn gray
[01:55.31] All our memories in my head
[01:58.74] It's time to bury 'em away
[02:00.12] Away deep inside the valley
[02:02.27] It's gonna be okay, hey
[02:13.77] 
[02:03.71] Ah, na-na, na-na, ah, na-na, na-na
[02:07.35] Ah, na-na, na-na, ah, na-na, na-na
[02:10.79] Ah, na-na, na-na, ah, na-na, na-na
[02:14.03] Ah, na-na, na-na, ah, na-na, na-na
[02:31.03] 
[02:16.89] I'm walking through the valley of lies (ah, na-na-na-na)
[02:20.05] I see a coffin, perfect fit for my size
[02:23.66] They won't open, got silky stitch in my eye (ah, na-na-na-na)
[02:27.01] I'm hurting, and I lost my heart in the sky (ah, na-na-na-na)
[02:57.51] 
[02:32.58] On, and on, and on (and on)
[02:35.98] Keep fighting, Armageddon
[02:39.09] Now things are getting rough
[02:41.61] I never thought you'd be a lesson (go)
[02:46.30] Go, you go, you go (go)
[02:49.52] How come I never see ya? (See ya)
[02:53.19] I'm really getting close to giving up
[02:57.26] I hate the feeling
